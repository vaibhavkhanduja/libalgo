# Introduction

The libalgo is an simple abstracted library over two ML libs - Spark MLLIB http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html and XGBoost https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. The basic premise is to use the Spark DS and provide necessary underlying implementation simple enough for anybody to use.
