# Introduction

The libalgo is an simple abstracted library over two ML libs - Spark MLLIB http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html and XGBoost https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. The basic premise is to use the Spark DS and provide necessary underlying implementation simple enough for anybody to use.

#To Consume
- The library can be compiled using the maven pom.xml, except the xgboost dependency. Please refer to the docs of XGBoost to compile and install.

#To execute
There are sample programs as well as datasets which can be executed for running the applications. The sample applications are written in Scala and famililarity with Scala is a must.

# TODO
- Better documentation
- More examples and sample datasets
